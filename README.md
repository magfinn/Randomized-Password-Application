Randomized-Password-Application

This is an application that generates a randomized secure password based on the following user-selected criteria:
1. length of password
2. use of special characters in password
3. use of numbers in password
4. use of uppercase letters in passord

How it works:
When user clicks "generate password" a series of prompts will lead them through the criteria and, once completed, will display a random password within the selected criteria to the #password div.
